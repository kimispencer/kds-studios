To answer this question and because no database of this information existed at the time, a Python web scraping script was developed to pull lyrics from the top Billboard charts since its inception in the early 1900's. Using a Java based IDE and natural language processing, frequencies of noun entities (such as \"I\" and \"you\"), as well as common verbs that express relationships between those entities (such as \"love\", or \"hate\") were visualized."
